- AudioSorter : An utility that create folders and classify files depending on their names. Must be used with the following Unreal naming convention : SW_Category_SubCategory_FileName_VariationNumber.
- CSVCreator : An utility that scan a directory, list all the files included in it and create a CSV file containing all the filename. It also add an "objectpath" column for Wwise based on the hierarchy of the directory. Can be used in combination with AudioSorter to quickly classify files and create a CSV to import them into Wwise.
